# Assignment 7 (Q&A)

** At least 3 Project features regarding my assignment.

1. I have been using tailwind to design the project. for tailwind i have successfully installed all the component that the project needs. If someone want to redesign my project he/she can easily adopt the design pattern, as it is tailwind.

2. For some alert session i have been using sweet alert. By which i can easily shown the required alert in a very modified way. so that, the user can easily understand the point of alert message.

3. My project is responsive for mobile device (L-425px), Tablet (768px), Laptop (L - 1440px). So it will perfectly fit with that respective devices.

4. For json file i have put the relevant description regarding every course title. So anyone can easily assume the title.



** Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

So, for this assignment part i have been using 5 different state for storing various data. 

state 1 : courses : This state managed every single course from the json api. and stored the course materials.

state 2 : selectedCourse : In this state for managing the cart product, specially the course. when select the button the you can easily found that product in the cart section.

state 3: totalCredit : In the figma file there have mentioned about total credit hour, so i need to manage the total credit hour by using this state.

state 4: remainingCredit : when you select the course, you will have total 20 credit not more than this. so the less amount showing by this state.

state 5: courseAmount : When you purchase the couse, it will have a total amount of money. which is shown by this state.
